The best way to resolve this is to perform a flush to clear out the water from your pipes, please follow these steps:\n \n1. Run the tap closest to the water meter (most likely your garden tap) for 2-3 minutes, or until the water runs clear. If it does not run clear after 3 or more minutes please contact us.\n2. Wait 10-15 minutes without using any water in your property to allow the water to settle.\n3. Run the tap at the rear of the property, furthest from the Water Meter for about 2-3 minutes to draw all the dirty water out of your property. This should resolve the issue for you.\n\nThe water from our catchments is unfiltered, so over time sediment builds up in pipes which, when disturbed, gives water a yellow to brown appearance. The water is still treated so completely safe to drink, however understandably its appearance is concerning. If you find the front garden tap has discoloured water coming out of it after running it for several minutes, please give us a call on 132 462 or by replying to this email.");

Go out to your water meter and ensure that none of the piping appears kinked.\n2. Check the stop tap at the water meter is fully turned on. Turn on your garden tap and while the garden tap is open, adjust the stop tap on the street side of the meter to see if the water flow increases/decreases.\n3. If the numbers on the meter are moving despite all taps on the property closed, we would recommend to engage with a licensed plumber as there is an internal leak which is affecting your water pressure.\n4. Get a standard 10L bucket and fill it up at the garden tap, timing how long it takes to fill. If it takes longer than 30-45 seconds please give us a call.\n5. Is the pressure fine at the garden tap but worse inside? If so you should engage a plumber as there may be an internal fault reducing pressure.\n6. Are others in your street affected, or is it just your property with low pressure (at the garden taps). \n7. Finally, has the pressure always been bad, did it get worse one day or has it slowly deteriorated over time?\n  \nCall us on 132 642 if you have questions, or reply to this email to discuss this further, especially if the bucket test takes longer than 30-40 seconds.\n \nMost often water pressure issues are because of a Pressure Reduction Valve (PRV) located just after the meter. This can deteriorate over time leading to reduced pressure. This can be replaced by a plumber to fix the issue.\n \nPlease let us know how you go.");
